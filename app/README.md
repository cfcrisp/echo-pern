Echo
Enabling value-driven product decisions by aligning user feedback
with business goals.
Purpose:
-
To enable value-driven product decisions by aligning user feedback with business goals.
-
Explanation: Echo solves the critical challenge of organizing and prioritizing product
roadmaps by creating clear traceability from customer ideas and feedback to business
outcomes, ensuring startups build what truly matters.
-
Problem:
●
Fragmented feedback across channels, hard to tie to business strategy.
●
Unprioritized feature requests waste resources on low-impact features.
●
Customers suggest solutions, not root problems, leading to misaligned roadmaps.
●
Misalignment between business users and product teams.
●
Scales with size: startups lack structure, mid-sized firms face feedback volume,
enterprises deal with silos.
●
Lack of transparency with customers on feedback prioritization causes frustration.
Solution:
●
Organizes customer ideas & feedback by tying them to higher level business goals and
initiatives (e.g.,
“Reduce TTV by 30% in Q2”).
○
Example 1:
■ Goal: Reduce onboarding steps for new users by 40% in Q2.
■ Initiative: Streamline the initial setup process in the product.
■ Customer Feedback
●
"There are too many steps to get started.
"
●
"I don’t need all these fields during setup.
"
■ Customer Ideas:
●
“Add this field to the onboarding page.
”
■ How Echo Organizes: Echo groups these feedback items under the
initiative "Streamline the initial setup process,
" tying them to the goal of
reducing onboarding steps by 40%. This helps the team prioritize
simplifying the setup flow over other feature requests.
○
Example 2:
■ Goal: Reduce support tickets by 30% this year
■ Initiative: Enhance self-service capabilities
■ Customer Feedback:
●
“Your documentation has gaps”
■ Customer Ideas:
●
"Add a tutorial video for configuration"
●
"Create a search feature for the help section"
■ Echo Organization: Instead of treating these as separate feature
requests, Echo connects them to reveal the underlying problem of
insufficient self-help resources, allowing the team to build a
comprehensive solution rather than piecemeal fixes.
○
Example 3:
■ Goal: Increase enterprise plan upgrades by 25%
■ Initiative: Add enterprise-grade security features
■ Customer Feedback:
●
"Customer feels our RBAC is too limited”
■ Customer Ideas:
●
"Prospect wants Okta SSO integration"
■ Echo Organization: Connects feedback to show a gap in enterprise
features.
●
Business users input feedback, communicate needs to product teams.
●
Customer portal for enterprises: customers view, rank, and prioritize their ideas.
●
Differentiator: simple, cost-effective, traceable roadmaps for all company sizes.
●
Portal impact: reduces churn by improving transparency, ensures roadmaps reflect
customer priorities.
